# Manual Testing Portfolio â€“ bol.com Case Study

## Overview

This portfolio section demonstrates my manual testing skills using bol.com as a case study. I have designed a set of test cases to validate key functionalities of the bol.com website, including search functionality, product detail display, adding a product to the shopping cart, and the checkout process. These test cases highlight my ability to plan, document, and execute manual tests to ensure a seamless user experience.
